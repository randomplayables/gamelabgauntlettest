# Gauntlet Number Guess Game

## About the Game

Build a gauntlet number guessing game where the challenger chooses the number and the opponent has to guess it.

## How to Play

One player (the challenger) selects a secret number within the allowed range. The opponent then makes repeated guesses to identify the secret number. After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. A history of all guesses and feedback is tracked, and the round ends once the correct number is found.
